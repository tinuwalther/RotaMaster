# RotaMaster V5

Absence and duty scheduling program for teams based on Pode, and [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/), created with ChatGPT prompt for JavaScript.

Each time the page is loaded, the system checks whether the file for the next year's holidays already exists. If the file does not yet exist, the public holidays in Switzerland are calculated for the cantons of Bern, Zurich, St. Gallen and Graub√ºnden and the file is created with these values. You never have to worry about it again, the public holidays are simply there.

If you want to create the holidays for a different year, you can call the API with the desired year. For example with PowerShell:

````Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/api/year/new -Method Post -Body 2025````

## Login

## Functionality

The RotaMaster is a Web service based on Pode.

All of the APIs on the backend are written in PowerShell and the frontend is written in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

It would be nice to use the [OpsGenie API](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/api-overview) to export/import Pikett-events into OpsGenie.

## Modules

The following PowerShell-Modules are mandatory:

- Pode
- PSSQLite

## Folders

The RotaMaster needs the following folder-structure:

````cmd
RotaMaster
+---api
+---archiv
+---bin
+---errors
+---img
+---public
|   +---assets
|   |   +---BootStrap
|   |   +---img

|   \---img
\---views
````
