# RotaMaster V5

The RotaMaster is a Web service based on Pode.

All of the APIs on the backend are written in PowerShell and the frontend is written in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

Absence and duty scheduling program for teams based on Pode, and [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/), created with ChatGPT prompt for JavaScript.

Each time the page is loaded, the system checks whether the file for the next year's holidays already exists. If the file does not yet exist, the public holidays in Switzerland are calculated for the cantons of Bern, Zurich, St. Gallen and Graub√ºnden and the file is created with these values. You never have to worry about it again, the public holidays are simply there.

If you want to create the holidays for a different year, you can call the API with the desired year. For example with PowerShell:

````Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/api/year/new -Method Post -Body 2025````

It possible to use the [OpsGenie API](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/api-overview) to create and delete Pikett-events in OpsGenie.

+---errors
+---img
+---public
|   +---assets
|   |   +---BootStrap
|   |   +---img
|   |   +---Jquery
|   |   \---rotamaster
|   \---img
\---views
````

## Create On-Call-Schedule

Currently there is a PowerShell-Script to create a new rotation and save it as RotaMaster/api/on-call-rota-2025.csv:

````powershell
RotaMaster/bin/New-OnCallSchedule.ps1 -StartDate '2025-03-01' -EndDate '2025-12-31'
````

You can check this ratation in the RotaMaster-calendar and if the rotation passed, then you can import it in to the table events with a PowerShell-Script:

````powershell
RotaMaster/bin/Import-ToSqLiteTable.ps1 -FilePath ../api/on-call-rota-2025.csv -ImportToDatabase
````
